# Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are operators in programming that manipulate individual bits in a binary number. These operators are used to perform low-level operations such as bit manipulation, bit shifting, and bit masking. Bitwise operators work on integer types in most programming languages.

## Types of Bitwise Operators

There are six bitwise operators in C language, as shown below:

1. **& (Bitwise AND)** - This operator performs a bitwise AND operation on two integers. It returns a 1 in each bit position where both operands have a 1 and 0 elsewhere.

2. **| (Bitwise OR)** - This operator performs a bitwise OR operation on two integers. It returns a 1 in each bit position where at least one operand has a 1 and 0 elsewhere.

3. **^ (Bitwise XOR)** - This operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on two integers. It returns a 1 in each bit position where only one operand has a 1 and 0 elsewhere.

4. **~ (Bitwise NOT)** - This operator performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single integer. It returns the one's complement of the integer, i.e., all the bits are inverted.

5. **<< (Left Shift)** - This operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand.

6. **>> (Right Shift)** - This operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand.

## Conclusion

Bitwise operators are essential for low-level programming tasks and can significantly improve the performance of code.
However, they can be challenging to use for beginners. Understanding the working of these operators is essential to make 
efficient use of them in programs.
